#Image Classification with Fashion MNIST Dataset
This project focuses on developing a robust convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurately classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Fashion-MNIST serves as a contemporary alternative to the classical MNIST dataset, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items categorized into 10 distinct classes.

#1. Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to develop a CNN model capable of accurately classifying fashion images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. This README provides a detailed overview of our methodology, model architecture, training process, results, challenges encountered, insights gained, and improvements made to enhance accuracy.

#2. Dataset Overview
The Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image measures 28x28 pixels and is grayscale. The images represent various fashion products categorized into 10 classes. The pixel values range from 0 to 255, denoting their intensity. Each image is accompanied by a corresponding class label, facilitating supervised learning tasks.

#3. Data Preprocessing
Our data preprocessing pipeline involved the following steps:
Dataset Loading: The Fashion-MNIST dataset was imported using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
Normalization: Pixel values were normalized to a standardized range of [0, 1] to ensure consistency and facilitate model convergence.
Data Reshaping: The data was reshaped to align with the input requirements of the CNN, incorporating an additional channel dimension.
Label Encoding: Class labels were transformed into categorical vectors using one-hot encoding, simplifying the classification process.

#4. Model Development
Our CNN model architecture was designed to optimize performance and facilitate accurate image classification. The key components of our model include:
Convolutional Layers: These layers were used to extract salient features from input images, followed by max-pooling operations for dimensionality reduction.
Dropout Layers: Strategically inserted dropout layers were employed to mitigate overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.
Fully Connected Layers: These layers processed the flattened output of the convolutional layers, facilitating feature aggregation and classification.
Output Layer: The output layer utilized softmax activation to provide probability distributions across the 10 fashion categories.
